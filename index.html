	<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
	an hour now. On her desk, lying<br> between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her<br> work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite><i>On The Road</i></cite>. It had been Molly's<br> favorite book since college, and the longer she<br> spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
	<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar<br> Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
	people who have nothing better<br> to do. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the<br> llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something<br> better to do.</p>
